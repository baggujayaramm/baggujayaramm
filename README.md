# Hey there, I'm Jaya Ramm 👋

## About Me

I'm building my expertise in DevOps and cloud infrastructure - working with real tools, real problems, and real solutions.

When I'm not setting up pipelines or managing cloud resources, I enjoy keeping life balanced. Good tech comes from clear minds.

## Tech I Work With

**Cloud & Infrastructure**
- AWS ecosystem and services
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Linux system administration

**DevOps & Automation**
- Docker and Kubernetes orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline design and implementation
- Git workflows and version control

**Development**
- Backend services and APIs
- Frontend frameworks and web technologies
- Database design and management

**Currently Exploring**
- Advanced Kubernetes patterns
- Infrastructure monitoring and observability
- Security-first architecture

## My Approach

I believe in building reliable systems that actually solve problems. Good infrastructure shouldn't just work - it should be maintainable, scalable, and enjoyable to work with.
